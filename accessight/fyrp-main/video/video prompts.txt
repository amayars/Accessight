1.car road 
"A cinematic aerial shot of a serene countryside at sunset, showing a long, winding road cutting through green fields and grassy meadows. A red car drives smoothly along the road, heading toward the horizon. The sky is partially cloudy with soft pastel tones of the setting sun. Trees and a reflective water body line one side of the road, adding to the peaceful, scenic atmosphere. Camera slowly pans or follows the moving car from a drone-like perspective."
2. windmill
A cinematic video that begins with a view of a cloudy sky filled with soft, layered clouds in shades of blue and gray, creating a peaceful and slightly overcast atmosphere. The camera slowly tilts downward to reveal a wide, open landscape with green fields and multiple traditional windmills gently turning in the breeze. The windmills are spaced across the horizon, surrounded by grass, small hills, and a few scattered trees. The lighting is soft and diffused, consistent with an overcast sky, giving the entire scene a calm and natural tone. The camera moves smoothly to capture the serene countryside with the windmills spinning slowly in the wind
